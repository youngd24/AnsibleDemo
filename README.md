This repo includes a reference to [another repo](https://github.com/youngd24/vagrant-ansible-lab) used for the demo, to ensure you get that make sure you use git in the following manner:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/youngd24/AnsibleDemo
```

This results in that additional repo being cloned into the ```vagrant-ansible-demo``` directory.
